**What doctype do?**   
For HTML documents, browsers use a DOCTYPE at the beginning of the document to decide how to handle it. load the page in the right way (typically Standard Mode): without it, the browser will load the page in [Quirks-mode](#quirks-mode). In HTML5 the doctype is reduced to *<!DOCTYPE html>*.

**Modes**  
The layout engine of the browser uses three modes
* *<a name="quirks-mode"></a>Quirks mode*  
nonstandard behavior emulation of Navigator 4 and IE 5
* *<a name="almost-standard-mode"></a>Almost standard mode*  
Only a small number of quirks are implemented
* *<a name="full-standard-mode"></a>Full standard mode*  
the behavior is the one described by the HTML and CSS specifications.
